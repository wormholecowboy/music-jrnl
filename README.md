An app for inspiring, training, and recording musical phrases to expand your vocabulary.

This is my current project to learn full stack development. I'll be working on improving my skills with React and Tailwind, while learning Next and Remix.

The basic idea of the app is that it will have 3 sections: A generator, working area, and vocabulary.

The generator will generate random musical phrases. When you hear one you like, you can move it to the working area, where you can chain them together. This helps you work on a single phrase or connecting multiple phrases, so you can improve your ability to solo and improvise.

Further along, I will create a backend for the vocabulary section. You will be able to save phrases that you like for recall later. Then you can mix and match your personal vocabulary with new phrases from the generator.
